## Ingredients

| Qty.    | Item                       |
| ------- | -------------------------- |
| 225 g   | chocolate hazelnut spread  |
| 475 g   | heavy cream (well chilled) |
| 2 tsp   | vanilla extract            |
| 2 tsp   | espresso powder            |
| 1 pinch | salt (optional)            |
|         | whipped cream              |
|         | chocolate curls/shavings   |

## Steps

1. Microwave the chocolate hazelnut spread for 30 seconds to loosen.
   Let cool 5 minutes.
1. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, whip the heavy cream on
   high speed until soft peaks begin to form.
1. Add the chocolate hazelnut spread, espress powder, and salt. Whisk
   (being careful not to overmix) until smooth, 1-2 minutes. Watch closely,
   if you overwhip the chocolate will separate.
1. Divide the mousse among 4-6 small bowls. Cover with plastic wrap and
   chill for at least 1 hour, until set, or up to 5 days.
1. Top as desired with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.

## Notes

* Keep chilled. Serve immediately after removing from fridge.

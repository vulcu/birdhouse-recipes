steps:
  - |
    In a small pot over medium heat, combine milk and butter until melted and
    hot but not simmering. Stir in sugar and salt; remove from heat and let cool
    to lukewarm.
  - |
    In a large bowl, combine ½ cup warm water and yeast. Let stand until foamy,
    about 5 minutes.
  - |
    Add warm milk mixture to yeast and stir. Whisk in flours. Cover with plastic
    wrap and let stand until doubled in volume, 2 to 3 hours at room temperature
    or overnight in the refrigerator.
  - |
    Heat waffle iron. Whisk eggs and baking soda into waffle batter. Using a
    pastry brush or paper towel, lightly coat iron with melted butter.
  - |
    Cook waffles (using about ½ cup batter per waffle) until golden and crisp.
    Butter the iron in between batches as needed. Serve waffles immediately as
    they are ready, or keep them warm in a 200-degree oven until ready to serve.

notes:
  - |
    Yeast-risen waffles have a lovely, complex tang that works beautifully with
    whatever sweet topping you apply–honey, maple syrup, fruit jam. You can
    make the batter the night before and let it rise in the refrigerator until
    breakfast time. Or, it will rise at room temperature in a couple of hours,
    which makes these waffles a good choice for brunch.

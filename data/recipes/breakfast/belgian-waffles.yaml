    Note it is very important not to get yolk in this, as it will prevent egg
    whites from stiffening.
  - In a separate bowl, add egg yolks and beat until slackened.
  - Mix milk, oat milk, oil, and vanilla into egg yolks and stir gently until mixed.
  - Add wet mixture into dry ingredients and mix thoroughly until batter is smooth.

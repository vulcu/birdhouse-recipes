steps:
  - Beat egg until fluffy.
  - Add milk and melted butter (butter must be cool enough to not cook egg).
  - Add dry ingredients and mix well.
  - Heat a heavy griddle or fry pan which is greased with a little butter on a paper towel.
  - The pan is hot enough when a drop of water breaks into several smaller balls which 'dance' around the pan.
  - Pour a small amount of batter (approx 1/4 cup) into pan and tip to spread out or spread with a spoon.
  - When bubbles appear on surface and begin to break, turn over and cook the other side.

notes:
  - |
    For fluffier pancakes, separate out egg whites and beat to a soft peak. Add one
    extra 1/2 to 1 Tbsp of milk to batter, and gently fold in egg whites making sure
    to maintain their volume.
  - If using separated whisked egg white method, 1/2-1 Tbsp additional milk may be needed.
  - 3 oz oat milk + 3 oz cow's milk lends a nice flavor profile and slightly crisper top/bottom.
  - |
    Oat milk may be fully substituted for cow's milk here (other types of milk untried);
    flavor and color will change slightly and top/bottom will cook more crisp.
  - 1/2 tsp of Honey or Molasses may be substituted for Sugar.
  - |
    Blueberries should be added last after the batter has been thoroughly mixed.
    Sprinkle on top of batter and gently fold in immediately before cooking.
    If using fresh blueberries, dry after washing.

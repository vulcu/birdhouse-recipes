    COOK:
    Defrost ingredients.
  - Sprinkle cheese on one tortilla, enough to cover it.
  - Add olive or other vegetable oil to skillet, heat to medium-to-high heat.
  - Add ingredients.
  - Add enough paprika and cumin to thoroughly coat ingredients. Chicken should be reddish.
    Add salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper to taste.
  - Stir fry until cooked through.
  - Spread skillet contents over the layer of cheese on the tortilla.
  - Add oil to now-empty skillet, lower to low-to-medium heat. Turn skillet to coat in oil.
  - Add another layer of cheese over the filling, lay second tortilla on top.
  - Carefully lay the quesadilla in the skillet. Using your hand, press down a few times, pressing
    the quesadilla together and removing air pockets.
  - Cook for 5-6min, or until lightly browned.
  - Using a large spatula, carefully lift the quesadilla. Add more oil to skillet, turning skillet
    to coat. Using other hand, carefully flip quesadilla over and set in skillet.
  - Cook for another 4-5min, or until second side is lightly browned.
  - Remove from heat, cut into six pieces using pizza cutter or large knife.
  - Serve with hot sauce and sour cream.

notes:
  - A white onion instead of red also works.
  - For additional heat, add 1-2 habanero or other hot peppers.
  - Seasoning should be more than you would ordinarily use, as it will need to shine through the
    rest of the quesadilla.
  - Careful to not overcook chicken, as it will cook further within quesadilla.
  - Quesadilla cheese can be used instead of or in addition to a Mexican cheese blend, but will not
    have the same holding power, making flipping the quesadilla more difficult.
  - After spreading filling, leave the charred bits in the skillet to cook into the quesadilla.

steps:
  - In a medium saucepan, mix sugar, cocoa, and milk.

    Brink to a full, roiling boil, continue boiling for exactly
    1 minute, then remove from heat.
  - Quickly mix in peanut butter, butter, and vanilla extract.
  - Quickly mix in oatmeal.

    Immediately scoop cookie-sized balls onto wax paper and slightly
    flatten. Cookies will flatten more as they cool and dry, but
    not as much as oven cookies.

notes:

    Once you add the oatmeal, the mixture will begin to dry very
    quickly. Be quick or the final cookies will be dry and crumbly.
  - For creamier/smoother cookies, use slightly less oatmeal.

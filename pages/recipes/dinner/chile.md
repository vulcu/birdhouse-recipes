    saucepan or small pot.
3.  Add canned tomatoes, tomato sauce, black beans, and chili mix to pot. Mix.
    Put on medium heat.
4.  Sauté peppers and onion until soft. Do not caramelize onions.
5.  Transfer peppers and onions to pot.
6.  After chili starts to bubble, reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.

## Notes

Use any peppers you like, but poblanos work best. One poblano and one habenero
is 4/5 spicy.

# Pancakes

Serving: 6-8 pancakes
Prep: 20m
Cook: 20m

## Ingredients

| Qty.     | Item                    |
| -------- | ----------------------- |
| 1        | Egg                     |
| 3/4 cup  | Milk (see Notes)        |
| 2 Tbsp   | Butter                  |
| 1 cup    | Flour                   |
| 1 Tbsp   | Sugar (see Note)        |
| 1 tsp    | Baking Powder           |
| 1/2 tsp  | Salt                    |
| 1-2 Tbsp | Blueberries (optional)  |
| 1-2 Tbsp | Choccy Chips (optional) |

## Steps

1.  Beat egg until fluffy.
2.  Add milk and melted butter (butter must be cool enough to not cook egg).
3.  Add dry ingredients and mix well.
4.  Heat a heavy griddle or fry pan which is greased with a little butter on a
    paper towel.
5.  The pan is hot enough when a drop of water breaks into several smaller
    balls which 'dance' around the pan.
6.  Pour a small amount of batter (approx 1/4 cup) into pan and tip to spread
    out or spread with a spoon.
7.  When bubbles appear on surface and begin to break, turn over and cook the
    other side.

## Notes

For fluffier pancakes, separate out egg whites and beat to a soft peak. Add one
extra 1/2 to 1
Tbsp of milk to batter, and gently fold in egg whites making sure to maintain
their volume.

- Milk
  - If using separated whisked egg white method, 1/2-1 Tbsp additional milk may
    be needed
  - 3 oz oat milk + 3 oz cow's milk lends a nice flavor profile and slightly
    crisper top/bottom
  - Oat milk may be fully substituted for cow's milk here (other types of milk
    untried); flavor
    and color will change slightly and top/bottom will cook more crisp
- Sugar
  - 1/2 tsp of Honey or Molasses may be substituted for Sugar
- Blueberries/Chocolate chips
  - If added, should be added last after the batter has been thoroughly mixed.
    Sprinkle on top of
    batter and gently fold in immediately before cooking.
  - If using fresh blueberries, dry after washing.
